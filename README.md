This is a twist on the MVC Record Store project.  It was started as my first singular foray into full-stack .Net, but I've made a handful of changes, including the inclusion of Foundation 5, and SASS frameworks.  This is really more of an exercise, at this point, to demonstrate my interest and capability.
